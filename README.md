# 📚 Library Management System

The **Library Management System** is a comprehensive tool for managing library operations, including managing authors, publishers, books, and students. It provides seamless CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and an efficient book issuing process, along with OTP-based student registration and automated email notifications.The system is also Dockerized, making deployment even more efficient.

## 📝 How It Works

### 👨‍🎓 Student Registration

1. The student fills out a registration form.
2. An OTP is sent to the student's email.
3. Registration is completed only after successful OTP verification.

### 🔄 CRUD Operations

Admins can manage authors, publishers, books, and students through an easy-to-use interface. All changes are reflected in real-time.

### 📤 Issuing Books

Admins can select a student and a book to issue. The system will send an email to the student, detailing the book's return deadline.

### 💵 Fine Calculation

A ₹10 per day fine is applied for late returns. The fine must be paid before the return process can be completed.
